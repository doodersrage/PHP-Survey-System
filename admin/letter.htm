<p>Subject: The Annual Virginia Electronic Commerce Technology Center (VECTEC) Client Survey</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dear salutation fname</p>
<p>Each year, we survey out client to evaluate our performance and provide us with metrics that measure our success in terms of helping you achieve your electronic commerce goals. The Governer and the General Assembly have used this &quot;Report Card&quot; to justify continued funding for VECTEC. This report has been invaluable in sustaining our community outreach programs.</p>
<p>Once again it's that time of year and we ask that you complete this brief survey based only on the servies received during the period July 1 2007 through June 30, 2008. Your input gives us an indication on how well we are serving our clients and achieving the General Assembly's goals for advancing the Commonwealth's economic growth through e-commerce.</p>
<p>For your convenience, this survey can be completed online at www.vectec.org/clientsurvey or downloaded and mailed, or faxed. Our FAX number is 757-594-7833. If you have any questions, please call 757-594-7092 or e-mail Marty at mmccoy@vectec.org for assistance.</p>
<p>If you complete the survey online, please use the following tracking number ___________</p>
<p>We thank all of our friends for their support over the years. With your continues participation and interest, we will continue to promote economic growth in Virginia through the implementation of e-commerce technologies.</p>
<p>Sincerily,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>William N. Nuir, Director<br>
